# Felix tries to guess when to implicitly boot delegate in certain
# situations to ease integration without outside code. This feature
# is enabled by default, uncomment the following line to disable it.
#felix.bootdelegation.implicit=false

# The following property explicitly specifies the location of the bundle
# cache, which defaults to "felix-cache" in the current working directory.
# If this value is not absolute, then the felix.cache.rootdir controls
# how the absolute location is calculated. (See next property)
#org.osgi.framework.storage=${dollar}{felix.cache.rootdir}/felix-cache

# The following property is used to convert a relative bundle cache
# location into an absolute one by specifying the root to prepend to
# the relative cache path. The default for this property is the
# current working directory.
#felix.cache.rootdir=${dollar}{user.dir}

# The following property controls whether the bundle cache is flushed
# the first time the framework is initialized. Possible values are
# "none" and "onFirstInit"; the default is "none".

# The following property determines which actions are performed when
# processing the auto-deploy directory. It is a comma-delimited list of

# An undefined or blank value is equivalent to disabling auto-deploy
# processing.

# The following property specifies the directory to use as the bundle
# auto-deploy directory; the default is 'bundle' in the working directory.
#felix.auto.deploy.dir=bundle

# The following property is a space-delimited list of bundle URLs
# to install when the framework starts. The ending numerical component
# is the target start level. Any number of these properties may be
# specified for different start levels.
#felix.auto.install.1=

# The following property is a space-delimited list of bundle URLs

# Apache Felix Remote Shell Properties
#

# The remote shell does not listen on all interfaces by default; it only listens on the localhost. That is, by default 
# the remote shell is only accessible from the host on which the remote shell is running. To access the system from 
# another host, you have to configure the IP address of the interface to which the remote shell should be attached. 

# Security Note:
# This remote shell bundle does not employ any security at all. Thus if no security manager is active in the framework's 
# JVM, then any user connecting to the remote shell has full control over the framework. 

# To have some minimum level of security ensure the IP Address configured with the osgi.shell.telnet.ip property is not 
# publicly accessible.

# IP Address on which the remote shell is accessible.
osgi.shell.telnet.ip=127.0.0.1

# Port on which the remote shell is accessible.
osgi.shell.telnet.port=6666

# The maximum number of simultaneous connections.
osgi.shell.telnet.maxconn=2

#Sets the SO_TIMEOUT socket option to the given number of milliseconds. The default is no timeout.
