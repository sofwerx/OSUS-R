[README.md](README.md) contains basic instructions on building the software. This contains additional information about
building the code and notes for development.

# <a name="DirectoryStructure" />Directory Structure
The following convention is used for structuring directories (where a `*` denotes any folder matching the pattern):

* `cnf` - Configuration directory for Bnd, contains settings for OSGi bundle repositories and other build configurations
  (see [Configuration Project](#ConfigurationProject))
* `deps` - Shared 3rd party open source and off-the-shelf non-bundle dependencies used by the project. Libraries used by
  a single project will be in the lib folder of the project and not here
* `example.*` - Contains example code, some of which can be used by integration tests
* `mil.dod.th.*` - Contains any Terra Harvest specific code (more restrictive patterns are explained below)
    * `mil.dod.th.asset.*` - Contains all basic Terra Harvest assets, specialized assets should go in a separate
      workspace
    * `mil.dod.th.core.*` - Contains all Terra Harvest core API, the standard API that all implemenations must use
    * `mil.dod.th.ose.*` - Contains all OSUS-R code (anything that runs within a OSUS-R controller and also tests for the
      source)
        * `mil.dod.th.ose.emac.*` - Contains code specific to the EMAC SoM prototype
        * `mil.dod.th.ose.gui.*` - Contains code specific to the OSUS-SG web GUI
        * `mil.dod.th.ose.linux.*` - Contains code specific to a Linux controller
    * `mil.dod.th.checkstyle.ext` - Contains a Checkstyle extension rules project *(not currently used)*
    * `mil.dod.th.confluence.doclet` - Contains a Java doclet project for generating documentation in Confluence based
      on Java code *(not currently used)*
    * `mil.dod.th.junit4.test.runner` - Contains a test runner for integration tests that produces reports viewable from
      Eclipse and Jenkins
    * `mil.dod.th.word.htm.doclet` - Contains a Java doclet project for generating documentation in a Microsoft Word
      document based on Java code *(not currently used)*
* `reports` - Contains any generated reports from Checkstyle, PMD, etc that are not specific to a project
* `target` *deprecated* - Contains build configurations for building packages of software suited for a particular
  purpose or platform (e.g., building the controller application for a Windows target). In the future separate
  application project should be created (e.g., mil.dod.th.ose.controller.application)

## Other Conventions

### <a name="IntegrationTests" />Integration Tests
Integration tests are found in the project ending in `.integration` and map to the project with the same prefix. For
example, `mil.dod.th.ose.remote.integration` contains the integration tests for `mil.dod.th.ose.remote`. A deprecated
project contains integration tests in `mil.dod.th.ose.integration` and apply to the core mostly. These tests should be
moved to specific integration test projects going forward.

### Platform Interface
Platform interface projects are found in `mil.dod.th.ose.*.platform` or `mil.dod.th.ose.*.serial` where the exact
location depends on the platform name. For example, `mil.dod.th.ose.linux.serial` contains the serial port project
for Linux.

## <a name="ConfigurationProject" />Configuration Project
The configuration project located at `cnf` is organized as follows (does not include details of cnf files not currently
used):

* `ant` - Common Ant build files and property files that can be used by all projects (see
  [Ant Common Build Files](#AntCommons))
* `buildrepo` - Bundle repository for build path only dependencies
* `checkstyle` - Checkstyle rule configurations used by the project
* `ext` - Contains extensions for Bnd such as defining which OSGi bundle repositories are available
* `localrepo` - Bundle repository for bundles that are used for build dependencies and also at runtime
* `plugins` - Contains libraries used by Bnd
* `pmd` - PMD rule configurations used by the project
* `runrepo` - Bundle repository for runtime bundles only
* `buildinfo.properties` - Contains properties for the current system version. This version can be viewed from the
  controller shell using the `version` command.
* `rootBuild.xml` - Root build file for Ant used to build the system as whole
* `tmp.build.properties` - Contains properties generated during a build containing metadata about the build process.
  Metadata can be viewed from the controller shell using the `buildInfo` command.

# Building System
As detailed in [README.md](README.md), Ant is used to build the software.

## <a name="AntCommons" />Ant Common Build Files
The common files in `cnf/ant` are used as follows:

* `commons.xml` *(deprecated)* - Contains common targets and definitions that could apply to any build file
* `default.properties` *(deprecated)* - Contains all of the basic properties shared among build files
* `emac-commons.xml` - Contains common targets and definitions that apply to any EMAC build file
* `gui-commons.xml` - Contains common targets and definitions that apply to any GUI build file
* `integration-commons.xml` *(deprecated)* -  Imports `java-commons.xml`, contains targets and definitions that apply to
  all integration test projects (see [Integration Tests](#IntegrationTests))
* `protobuf.xml` - Contains common targets to work with protocol buffers
* `shared.xml` *(deprecated)* - Contains targets to build all *shared* code, this should be removed and calls should be
  made directly to individual projects
* `target-commons.xml` *(deprecated)* -  Contains targets and definitions that apply to building a target
  (see [Directory Structure](#DirectoryStructure))
* `tools.xml` *(deprecated)* - Contains targets to build all *tools*, this should be removed and calls should be
  made directly to individual projects

## Ant Targets
There are many standard targets that apply to multiple projects. These targets are defined here, while specific targets
used in one or a few places are not detailed.

These targets apply to Java projects (by importing `cnf/build.xml`):

* `init` - Initializes properties, each target must depend on this target to run properly
* `clean` - Removes previously generated/compiled files.
* `build` - Builds the projects
* `cc.instrument` - Adds Cobertura code coverage information to the compiled classes so they show up in coverage metrics
* `compile` - Compiles source code for the project
* `compileTest` - Compiles test code for the project if `test` folder exists
* `deploy-component` - Copies the built component to the target being deployed
* `junit` - Runs unit tests for the project if `test` folder exists
* `test` - Runs Bnd level integration tests for the project (will fail if not applicable)

These targets apply to *deprecated* (should create bnd integration project in the future) integration projects (by
importing `cnf/ant/integration-commons.xml`):

* `build-supporting` - Build any supporting projects needed by the integration tests
* `deploy-target` - Deploy the target being tested to `build/deploy` of the integraton test project, this is where the
  target will run during integration testing
* `setup` - Copies files need for integration testing (e.g., additional test bundles, configuration files)
* `integration-test` - Runs the integrtion tests

These targets apply to *deprecated* (should create bnd application project in the future) target projects (by importing
`cnf/ant/target-commons.xml`):

* `build-deploy` - Builds then calls `deploy` for a one step build and deploy
* `build-with-deps` - Ant target must be overridden in project for the target project specific building
* `deploy-app` - Ant target must be overridden in project for target project specific deployment
* `deploy` - Wrapper target that calls `deploy-clean`, `deploy-app` and `zip`
* `deploy-clean` - Remove all deployed files from the `deploy` folder
* `zip` - Zip the deployed target

These targets apply to GUI related projects (by importing `cnf/ant/gui-commons.xml`):

* `archive-log-files` - Archive log files produced by the web GUI to the `reports` folder
* `check-web-app` - Check if the web GUI is running by checking the root URL of the application
* `start-glassfish` - Start the web GUI Glassfish server
* `stop-delete-glassfish` - Stop the web GUI Glassfish server and delete the domain for the web GUI
* `stop-glassfish` - Stop the web GUI Glassfish server

These targets apply to EMAC related projects (by importing `cnf/ant/emac-commons.xml`):

* `install-to-target` - Install the EMAC target software to an EMAC controller
* `reboot-target` - Reboot the EMAC target

In addition, these macros apply as well:

* `scp-from` - Secure copy files from target machine to local machine
* `scp-to` - Secure copy files to target machine from local machine
* `ssh` - SSH command to a target machine

In additon, each Ant build file can override a target to behave differently, but it should perform the same overall
function.

If using Eclipse for development, follow these in addition [instructions](ECLIPSE-README.md).
