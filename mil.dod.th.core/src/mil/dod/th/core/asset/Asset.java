/**
 * <p>
 * Interface for interacting with an asset (a physical device that typically produces data or responds to a command), 
 * such as a motion detector, camera, UAV, security gate, valve actuator, engine or radio. One asset may have multiple 
 * sensors. Every asset will have some kind of comms (radio, serial port, Ethernet port, ...) that the plug-in uses.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * All functionality of an asset needed by the consumer should be available through this interface. It should never be
 * necessary to use the {@link AssetProxy} interface implemented by the plug-in. For example, if SensorAsset implements
 * {@link AssetProxy}, consumers should not directly access SensorAsset methods, but instead access this interface.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The main jobs of an asset are:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Turn on comms and generate/consume data when activated.</li>
 * <li>Handle all the protocol(s) for talking to the asset comms/hardware.</li>
 * <li>Provide items-of-interest to the rest of the system when collected.</li>
 * <li>Capture data to file on demand.</li>
 * <li>Turn off comms and sit when de-activated.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * Instances of an Asset are managed (created, tracked, deleted) by the core. This interface should never be implemented
 * by a plug-in. Instead, a plug-in implements {@link AssetProxy} to define custom behavior that is invoked when 
 * consumers use this interface. To interact with an asset, use the {@link AssetDirectoryService}.
 * </p>
