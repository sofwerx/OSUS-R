/**
 * This interface is for a transport layer. The transport layer takes care of packetization, fragmentation, reassembly,
 * reliability, etc. A transport layer can be connection oriented, meaning the {@link #connect} method must be called
 * before sending a message and {@link #send(ByteBuffer)} or {@link #send(TransportPacket)} must be used. For 
 * connection-less transport layers, the {@link #connect} and {@link #disconnect} methods cannot be called and 
 * either {@link #send(ByteBuffer, Address)} or {@link #send(TransportPacket, Address)} must be used to send data. A 
 * transport layer's capabilities XML dictates whether the layer is connection oriented or not using {@link 
 * mil.dod.th.core.ccomm.transport.capability.TransportLayerCapabilities#isConnectionOriented()}. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * All functionality of a transport layer needed by the consumer should be available through this interface. It should 
 * never be necessary to use the {@link TransportLayerProxy} interface implemented by the plug-in. For example, if 
 * SomeTransportLayer implements {@link TransportLayerProxy}, consumers should not directly access SomeTransportLayer 
 * methods, but instead access this interface.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Instances of a TransportLayer are managed (created, tracked, deleted) by the core. This interface should never be 
 * implemented by a plug-in. Instead, a plug-in implements {@link TransportLayerProxy} to define custom behavior that is
 * invoked when consumers use this interface. To interact with a transport layer, use the {@link 
 * mil.dod.th.core.ccomm.CustomCommsService}.
