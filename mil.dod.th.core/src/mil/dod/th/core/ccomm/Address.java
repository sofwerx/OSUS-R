 * All functionality of an address needed by the consumer should be available through this interface. It should never be

 * implements {@link AddressProxy}, consumers should not directly access SomeAddress methods, but instead access this 
 * interface.

 * Instances of an Address are managed (created, tracked, deleted) by the core. This interface should never be 
 * implemented by a plug-in. Instead, a plug-in implements {@link AddressProxy} to define custom behavior that is 
 * invoked when consumers use this interface. To interact with an address, use the {@link AddressManagerService}.
